By completing this workshop, i got to learn an important library to measure time in c++. We can measure the efficiency of any blocks of code using this library.
Also, I learnt about the rule of five(an upgrade from the rule of three ).Although, a mere optimization rather than a necessity , rule of five involves the design 
and implementation of the move and move asssignment operator which are resposnible to safely cut and paste object data from one to another without memory leaks.
I modified the implementaion of std::move function to move while managing the dynamically allocated resources inside the class.

The reason move operator is so faster than copy is because it involves only pointer allocation and deallocation while copy involves transferring everything by value.



Yes , I was thinking of that when I was writing the code and rereading the whole file seemed a little bit inefficient .
we can do that by using a temporary vector of strings to collect data and size first and then just transfer to the new dynamically allocated array .

I found that system clock is affected by other variables like ddaylight savings, time zone synchronization etc while steady clock maintains an absolute ticks between the intervals .
